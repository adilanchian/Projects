# Projects
This is a compilation of all programs I have created in multiple high level languages. Some of these programs were created for class assignments and posted upon successful completion of the course. Class assignments will be listed according to class and semester year. Code for these programs were created by me, unless otherwise stated in code comments. The concepts of these programs were created by University Of Central Florida professors, but executed by myself.<br>

# AddAll.c
Created for Computer Science 1 <br>
<br>
Given a set of numbers your goal is to add them all, while minimizing the cost of 
the addition. At any point, you may choose to add any two of the integers. 
The cost of doing so is simply the sum of the two numbers.

#ListString.c
Created for Computer Science 1 <br>
<br>
This program uses linked lists to represent strings. Functions have been created
to manipulate these linked lists. 

#Hillcipher.java
Created for Security In Computing <br>
<br>
Write a program that encrypts the alphabetic letters in a file using the 
Hill cipher. The program will take two command line parameters containing the 
names of the file storing the encryption key and the file to be encrypted. 
The program must generate output to the console (terminal) in a specified format.

#Boggle.java
Created for Objected Oriented Programming <br>
<br>
This is an desktop app of the classic board game, Boggle. This was a semester
long project.

#Age
<br>
Simple project that calculates the users "human age" into dog years. This was 
created using Swift and Xcode.

#Gussing Game
<br>
Simple project that randomly generates a number between one and five. The user
has to guess what the number is. This was created using Swift and Xcode.

#The Forest
Created at UHack 2016<br>
<br>
This "choose your own adventure" game was created for the sole purpose of being 
played on the Apple Watch. There are multiple paths that can be taken. All items and 
animals encountered in the game are all randomly generated from an array. To

#Submerged Mineral Oil Computer
<br>
This computer is Submerged in five gallons of mineral oil, a non-conductive liquid that will help cool computer components. I added a pump to circulate the oil through a radiator
to cool while in use. In 'submerged-mineral-oil-computer' there is a video of
the computer turned on and running inside of the mineral oil. It has been 
running with no problems for over a year now.

#Desktop Application
<br>
I have created a desktop application for SightPlan - a multifamily software development
company. I used Electron as the base for this project because its native approach on different
platforms. It takes the web client of SightPlan's software and wraps it into a more
user friendly application that I assigned multiple features, such as:<br>
1. Auto-Sign in<br>
2. Full dynamic menu bar<br>
3. Native Operating system look<br>
4. Inline PDF Viewer
<br>
<br>
This application was created for OS X and Windows 7 and up. This application
is currently being used by twenty-two employees internally. Unfortunately, 
I cannot post any source code on this public repository.
