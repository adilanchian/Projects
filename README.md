# Projects
This is a compilation of all programs I have created in multiple high level languages. Some of these programs were created for class assignments and posted upon successful completion of the course. Class assignments will be listed according to class and semester year. Code for these programs were created by me, unless otherwise stated in code comments. The concepts of these programs were created by University Of Central Florida professors, but executed by myself.<br>

# AddAll.c
- Created for Computer Science 1 <br>
Description<br>
Given a set of numbers your goal is to add them all, while minimizing the cost of 
the addition. At any point, you may choose to add any two of the integers. 
The cost of doing so is simply the sum of the two numbers.

#ListString.c
- Created for Computer Science 1 <br>
Description<br>
This program uses linked lists to represent strings. Functions have been created
to manipulate these linked lists. 

#Hillcipher.java
- Created for Security In Computing <br>
Description<br>
Write a program that encrypts the alphabetic letters in a file using the 
Hill cipher. The program will take two command line parameters containing the 
names of the file storing the encryption key and the file to be encrypted. 
The program must generate output to the console (terminal) in a specified format.

#Boggle.java
- Created for Objected Oriented Programming <br>
Description<br>
This is an desktop app of the classic board game, Boggle. This was a semester
long project.

#Age
Description<br>
Simple project that calculates the users "human age" into dog years. This was 
created using Swift and Xcode.

#Gussing Game
Description<br>
Simple project that randomly generates a number between one and five. The user
has to guess what the number is. This was created using Swift and Xcode.

#The Forest
- Created at UHack 2016
Description<br>
This "choose your own adventure" game was created for the sole purpose to play 
on the Apple Watch. There are multiple paths that can be taken. All items and 
animals encountered in the game are all randomly generated from an array. To

#Submerged Mineral Oil Computer
Description<br>
A project that I wanted to do for a very long time. This computer is Submerged
in five gallons of mineral oil, a non-conductive liquid that actually will help
cool computer components. I added a pump to circulate the oil through a radiator
to cool while in use. In 'submerged-mineral-oil-computer' there is a video of
the computer turned on and running inside of the mineral oil. This is one of my 
most favorite projects. It has been running with no problems for over a year now.

#Desktop Application
Description<br>
I have created a desktop client for a company that needed it for internal use.
I used Electron as the base for this project for its native approach on different
platforms. It takes the web client of their software and wraps it into a more
user friendly application that was given multiple features such as:<br>
- Auto-Sign in<br>
- Full dynamic menu bar<br>
- Native Operating system look<br>
This application was created for OS X and Windows 7 and up. This application
is currently being used by twenty-two employees internally for a company called 
SightPlan. Unfortunately, I cannot post any source code on this public repository.
