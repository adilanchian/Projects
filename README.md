# Projects
This is a compilation of all programs I have created in multiple high level languages. Some of these programs were created for class assignments and posted upon successful completion of the course. Class assignments will be listed according to class and semester year. Code for these programs were created by me, unless otherwise stated in code comments. The concepts of these programs were created by University Of Central Florida professors, but executed by myself.<br>

# AddAll.c
- Created for Computer Science 1 <br>
Description<br>
Given a set of numbers your goal is to add them all, while minimizing the cost of 
the addition. At any point, you may choose to add any two of the integers. 
The cost of doing so is simply the sum of the two numbers.

#ListString.c
- Created for Computer Science 1 <br>
Description<br>
This program uses linked lists to represent strings. Functions have been created
to manipulate these linked lists. 

#Hillcipher.java
- Created for Security In Computing <br>
Description<br>
Write a program that encrypts the alphabetic letters in a file using the 
Hill cipher. The program will take two command line parameters containing the 
names of the file storing the encryption key and the file to be encrypted. 
The program must generate output to the console (terminal) in a specified format.

#Boggle.java
- Created for Objected Oriented Programming <br>

This is an desktop app of the classic board game, Boggle. This was a semester
long project.
